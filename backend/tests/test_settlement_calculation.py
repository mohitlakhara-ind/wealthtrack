"""
Tests for Splitwise import settlement calculation logic.

These tests validate that:
1. userShares are correctly calculated (netEffect = paidShare - owedShare)
2. Settlements are correctly created between creditors and debtors
3. Payment transactions are handled correctly (treated uniformly with expenses)
4. Final balances match expected values

The key insight from debugging the "Ins valsura internship" group:
- For EVERY transaction (expense or payment), each user has:
  - paidShare: amount they contributed
  - owedShare: amount they should pay
  - netEffect = paidShare - owedShare
    - Positive = they are owed money (creditor)
    - Negative = they owe money (debtor)
- Settlements are created by matching debtors to creditors
