## Overview

The Expense Service, a core component detailed in the [Micro-plan](./micro-plan.md#4-expense-management-service) and [Settlement Service section](./micro-plan.md#5-settlement-service), manages expense creation, splitting, and settlement calculations for WealthTrack. It handles the core business logic of expense tracking and debt settlement optimization using a directed graph algorithm. This service interacts closely with the [Group Service](./group-service.md) for managing expenses within groups and relies on the [Auth Service](./auth-service.md) for user authentication and authorization. The underlying data structures are defined in the [Non-Relational Database Schema](./nonrelational-database-schema.md).

## Key Features

- **Expense Management**: Create, read, update, delete expenses
- **Smart Settlement**: Automatic settlement calculation with debt minimization algorithm
- **Friends Balance Aggregation**: Cross-group balance summary for users
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate settlement calculations after expense operations

## Core Algorithm: Settlement Simplification

The service uses a directed graph algorithm to minimize transactions:

1. **Calculate Net Balance**: For each user, compute `net_balance = total_paid - total_owed`
2. **Separate Debtors/Creditors**: Sort users by net balance (negative = debtor, positive = creditor)
3. **Two-Pointer Optimization**: Match highest debtor with highest creditor iteratively
4. **Minimize Transactions**: Reduce number of settlements to minimum required

```plantuml
@startuml SettlementAlgorithm
!define debtor(x) class x << (D,#FFB6C1) >>
!define creditor(x) class x << (C,#90EE90) >>

package "Settlement Calculation" {
  debtor(UserA) : owes $150
  debtor(UserB) : owes $50
  creditor(UserC) : owed $100
  creditor(UserD) : owed $100
  
  UserA --> UserC : $100
  UserA --> UserD : $50
  UserB --> UserD : $50
}

note right : Algorithm reduces 6 potential\ntransactions to 3 optimal ones

## Service Architecture Flow

```plantuml
@startuml ExpenseServiceFlow
participant Client
participant "Expense API" as API
participant "Settlement Engine" as Engine
participant "MongoDB" as DB
participant "Cache" as Cache

Client -> API: POST /groups/{id}/expenses
API -> DB: Insert expense document
API -> Engine: Calculate settlements for expense
Engine -> DB: Insert settlement documents
Engine -> Engine: Run optimization algorithm
Engine -> Cache: Cache optimized settlements
API -> Client: Return expense + settlements + optimization

note right of Engine
Settlement Algorithm:
1. Fetch all group settlements
2. Calculate net balances
3. Apply two-pointer optimization
4. Generate minimal transaction set
end note

Client -> API: GET /users/me/friends-balance
API -> Cache: Check cached balances
alt Cache Miss
  API -> DB: Aggregate across all user groups
  API -> Engine: Calculate cross-group net balances
  API -> Cache: Store aggregated results
end
API -> Client: Return friends balance summary

## Data Models Alignment

Based on the [Non-Relational Database Schema](./nonrelational-database-schema.md), here's how the API maps to collections:

### Expense Creation Flow:
1. **Insert into [`expenses` collection](./nonrelational-database-schema.md#3-expenses-collection)**: Main expense document with embedded splits
2. **Insert into [`settlements` collection](./nonrelational-database-schema.md#4-settlements-collection)**: Individual settlement records for debt tracking
3. **Update group statistics**: Cached aggregations for performance (potentially in [`groups` collection](./nonrelational-database-schema.md#2-groups-collection) or a dedicated analytics store)

### Settlement Optimization:
1. **Query [`settlements` collection](./nonrelational-database-schema.md#4-settlements-collection) by groupId**: Get all pending settlements
2. **Calculate net balances**: Aggregate by user pairs
3. **Apply graph algorithm**: Minimize transaction count
4. **Return optimized structure**: Suggested payments

## Error Handling

```http
400 Bad Request - Invalid expense data
401 Unauthorized - Invalid or expired token
403 Forbidden - Not a group member
404 Not Found - Group or expense not found
409 Conflict - Expense already exists or settlement mismatch
422 Unprocessable Entity - Validation errors (splits don't sum to total)
500 Internal Server Error - Server processing error
```

## Rate Limiting

- **Expense Creation**: 10 requests/minute per user
- **Settlement Calculations**: 5 requests/minute per group
- **Friends Balance**: 20 requests/minute per user
- **Analytics**: 30 requests/minute per user

## Caching Strategy

- **Group Balances**: Cache for 5 minutes, invalidate on new expense
- **Friends Aggregation**: Cache for 10 minutes, invalidate on settlement update
- **Optimized Settlements**: Cache for 15 minutes per group
- **Analytics**: Cache for 1 hour, refresh daily for historical data
