## Quick Reference

### Key UX Principles
1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show only relevant information at each step
2. **Smart Defaults**: Pre-fill common values and selections
3. **Real-time Feedback**: Show calculations and validations immediately
4. **Error Prevention**: Validate inputs before allowing progression
5. **Consistent Interactions**: Use same patterns across similar features
6. **Accessibility First**: Support screen readers and large text
7. **Offline Support**: Cache data and sync when connection restored

### Navigation Structure
- **Bottom Navigation**: Home, Groups, Friends (3 main tabs)
- **Authentication Stack**: Login/Signup flow
- **Modal Stacks**: Expense creation, Settlement flows

- Support both light and dark modes with automatic switching
- Ensure accessibility compliance with screen readers and large text support
