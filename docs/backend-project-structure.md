# Backend Project Structure (Monolithic)

## Overview
This document outlines a recommended project structure for implementing the WealthTrack backend as a **monolithic application**. This structure promotes modularity, maintainability, and scalability within a single codebase. This example primarily assumes a Python-based environment (e.g., using FastAPI), but the principles can be adapted.

## Conceptual Root Directory Structure
The backend code will reside within a dedicated root folder, for example, `WealthTrack-backend/`.

```
/WealthTrack-backend/
|-- /app/                        # Core application code
|   |-- /api/                    # API endpoints and routing
|   |   |-- __init__.py
|   |   |-- v1/                  # API version 1

## Key Directory Explanations

*   `/app/`: Contains all the core application code.
    *   `api/v1/`: Defines the API interface. Route modules are domain-specific (e.g., `auth_routes.py`, `expense_routes.py`).
    *   `core/`: Core application settings (e.g., `config.py`), security utilities (`security.py`), and shared dependencies (`dependencies.py`).
    *   `db/`: Database interaction logic. Includes the DB client setup and repositories (e.g., `user_repo.py`) that abstract database operations.
    *   `models/`: Data models that represent your database entities (e.g., Pydantic models mapping to MongoDB documents).
    *   `schemas/`: Pydantic schemas for data validation and serialization of API requests and responses, organized by domain.
    *   `services/`: The business logic layer. Domain-specific service modules (e.g., `expense_service.py`) orchestrate data access and implement core functionalities.
    *   `utils/`: General utility functions.
    *   `main.py`: The entry point of your application (e.g., where you create your FastAPI instance and include routers).
*   `/tests/`: Contains all automated tests, with subdirectories mirroring the `/app/` structure where appropriate.
*   `Dockerfile`: Used to build a Docker container for the application.
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python package dependencies.
*   `.env.example`: A template for the environment variables.
*   `README.md`: Provides information about the project, how to run it, test it, etc.

This monolithic structure keeps related code for different domains (auth, users, groups, expenses) organized within a single application, simplifying development and deployment for smaller to medium-sized projects while still allowing for a good separation of concerns.
